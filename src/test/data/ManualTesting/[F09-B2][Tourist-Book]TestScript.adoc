This is a test script document to explain the steps to perform manual testing, including how to load the data file.

== Quick Start
. Download both touristbook.jar and SampleData.xml files
. Put both files in the same folder/location
. Create another folder named "data" and put the SampleData.xml file inside
. Rename the "SampleData.xml" to "addressbook.xml"
. Run touristbook.jar

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Marina Bay Sands`.
* Items in square brackets are OPTIONAL e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Marina Bay Sands t/attractions` or as `n/Marina Bay Sands`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/attractions`, `t/onestar t/twostars` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME a/ADDRESS`, `a/ADDRESS n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

== Help Command
The help command allows the user to view the available functions and commands. +
Format: `help` or `h` or pressing kbd:[F1]

[NOTE]
====
* The command is **case sensitive** +
* The command will ignore any other subequent parameters after the command word.
